# Tic Tac Toe Tutorial

A tic tac toe game first built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It will then be refactored using TypeScript. Then we'll use React to make the game more dynamic.

# Background

I received a newsletter email from Freecodecamp that included a link to a front end development course.

The [project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/frontend-web-development-in-depth-project-tutorial/) sounded fun!

This is my attempt to follow along with that course to refamiliarize with html/css/javascript, learn some extra skills (TypeScript and React!), and add a finished project to my github.
